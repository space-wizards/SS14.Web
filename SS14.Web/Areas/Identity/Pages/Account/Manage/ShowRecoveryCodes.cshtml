        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account, recovery even
        by email support will be highly unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something like a physical notepad or a digital notes app is a good place to put these down, while not recommended
        if you got a password manager it should have a notes or description field that you can use as well. It's also suggested to make multiple copies.
